<div style='text-align: justify;'>
<h4>Causal Signal:</h4>
 A continuous time signal 洧논(洧노) is called causal signal if the signal 洧논(洧노) = 0 for 洧노 < 0. Therefore, a causal signal does not exist for negative time. The unit step signal u(t) is an example of causal signal. 

 Similarly, a discrete time sequence x(n) is called the causal sequence if the sequence x(n) = 0 for n < 0.
 <br>
 <h4>Anti-Causal Signal:</h4>
 A continuous-time signal x(t) is called the anti-causal signal if x(t) = 0 for t > 0. Hence, an anti-causal signal does not exist for positive time.

 Similarly, a discrete time sequence x(n) is said to be anti-causal sequence if the sequence x(n) = 0 for 洧노 > 0.
 <h4>Non-Causal Signal:</h4>
  A signal which is neither causal nor anti-causal is called the non-causal signal. Hence, by the definition, a signal that exists for positive as well as negative time is neither causal nor anti-causal, it is non-causal signal. The sine and cosine signals are examples of non-causal signal

### 5.6 Discussion:
<div style='text-align: justify;'>
From figure 5.1, 5.3 and 5.3, a generalized form of causal, anti-causal and non-causal signal could be realized. The only poles and zeros of these expressions were plotted in figure 5.2, 5.4 and 5.6 respectively.

### 5.7 Conclusion:
<div style='text-align: justify;'>
In this experiment, I have learned about z-transform, zeros-poles determination and how to plot those zeros and poles in matlab. The experiment was executed successfully.
